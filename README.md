This is a simple web-based calendar application designed to schedule a work day. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilizes jQuery, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts.

### Features

- Displays current date and time.
- Allows users to input and save text in hourly blocks from 9AM to 3PM.
- Blocks are color-coded based on whether they represent the past, present, or future.

### Installation

To use the Work Day Scheduler, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There is no need to install any additional software or libraries.

### Usage

Upon loading the application, the current date and time will be displayed at the top of the page. Each hourly block contains a text input field and a save button. Users can input their plans for each hour into the text input field and save their entry by clicking the corresponding save button.

The application will automatically color-code the blocks based on the current time. Blocks representing past hours will be gray, blocks representing the current hour will be red, and blocks representing future hours will be green.
